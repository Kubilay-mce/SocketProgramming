# SocketProgramming

This is my Socket Programming Project which I created for data communication systems course.

This is a simple socket programming sample which is using TCP/IP protocol.

Main idea is a basic quiz show for connected users. Server has questions for clients and if clients answers correctly server sends a new question to them.
